    "# Smart Cab (Self driving cab)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem Statement**: A self-driving cab company Smartcab wanted to design a simulation of a self-driving cab.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal**: Demonstrate the use of RL techniques to develop an efficient and safe approach for tackling the issue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Project Description**:\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "The Smartcab's job is to pick up the passenger at one location and drop them off in another. Here is a list of things that they would love our Smartcab to take care of:\n",
    "- Drop off the passenger to the right location.\n",
    "- Save passenger's time by taking minimum time possible to drop off\n",
    "- Take care of passenger's safety and traffic rules\n",
    "\n",
    "There are different aspects that need to be considered here while modeling an RL solution to this problem: rewards, states, and actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Company also wanted to allow users to book a cab by sending a free text SMS containing source, destination and time of travel. Since SMS is a free text, different users can send same message in different ways, e.g.,\n",
    "1. I want to book a cab from cyber city to sector 48 at 5 pm.\n",
    "2. Please book my cab with pick up from cyber city, destination sector 48, and time of pick up 5 pm.\n",
    "3. Book a cab for me from sector 48, my pick-up is from cyber city at 5 pm.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the challenge for the company is to parse this free text and fetch three entities:\n",
    "- Pick up location\n",
    "- Destination\n",
    "- Time to pick up"

    "**Process Flow/Overall solution:**\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "Solve Open AI Gym environment “Taxi v2” using Q learning algorithm to learn a task of pickup, drop passengers and then evaluate the learned environment on the given data:\n",
    "\n",
    "sms.txt: This file contains 1000 text messages containing information of pickup location, drop location, and time of pickup\n",
    "\n",
    "**Task to be solved:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Train:\n",
    "1. Train a model using Q learning algorithm on tax v2 environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluation:\n",
    "    1. Take text from \"sms.txt\" and fetch pickup and drop from it.\n",
    "    2. Generate the random state from an environment and change the pick-up and drop as the fetched one from sms.txt\n",
    "    3. Evaluate you model performance on all the texts given in sms.txt. We have generated text for four locations given in city.csv\n",
    "    4. Have a check if the fetched pickup, drop is not matching with original pickup, drop given in “orig_df.csv”\n",
    "    5. If fetched pickup or/and drop does not match with the original, add penalty and reward -10 \n",
    "    6. Calculate the Total reward, penalties, Wrong pickup/drop predicted and Average time steps per episode."
